## Description
This plugin is designed to remove the restrictions that prevent users from performing copy operations in Microsoft 365 web applications, such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and others.
## Installation
To install this plugin, you need to use the Chrome browser's built-in extension loader for unpackaged extensions. Here's how to do it:

1. **Download or clone the Plugin Repository:** Download and extract the zip file or clone the repository of the plugin to a specific location on your computer.

2. **Open the Extension Management page in Chrome:**

    - Either navigate to `chrome://extensions` in the address bar.
   
3. **Switch On Developer Mode:** At the top right of the Extension Management page, activate the `Developer mode` toggle.

4. **Load the Unpacked Extension:**

    - Click the `Load unpacked` button that just appeared.
    - An explorer window will open. Navigate to where you saved the plugin and select the folder.

If the plugin folder is structured correctly, Chrome will load the extension, and you will see your extension listed with an `ID`, which is the unique extension ID.

**Remember to turn off Developer Mode after the extension is loaded to prevent any unnecessary changes to your browser settings.**
